There are 5 assignments, 2 of them are obligatory:

1. Flexbox/Grid
2. TODO app
3. Angular Payment Validation
4. (optional) Some algorithim question
5. (optional) Banking app

## Feedback

No technical feedback, due to my holidays could spend only 1.5 days (out of given 3.5 days) and did only first 3 assignments. The 2 optional have been done by rest applicants and that's why they didn't proceed (source: Rabobank Recruiter LinkedIn)
