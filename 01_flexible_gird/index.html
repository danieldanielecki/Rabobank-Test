<!-- NOTE: a bit confused about "Each cell of the grid can contain another 1x4 flexible grid." Currently that's not a problem to add another grid into one of the cells and achieve so-called Nested Grid, but to add so is not written in the assignment. Other than pointing this out that Nested Grid can be used it doesn't seems to be that has to be done. -->
